 @abstract A custom progress view that displays the progress in a circular
   shape. It includes two visual components: a subtle transparent background
   ring as a placeholder and a foreground ring representing the current
   progress state.
 
   Progress changes can be animated using the `setProgress:animated:` method
   where a `YES` value has to be passed as the `animated` argument.
